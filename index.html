  <h1>update: i started working on bringing run brackets back up.</h1>
  <p>it's gonna be a couple of months before i can have this up again, unfortunately.</p>
  <p>if you wanna help, or stay up-to-date, just email me (found below).</p>
  
  <p>update date: 03/06/20</p>
  
  <h2>bad news. run brackets is down for now.</h2>

  <p>unfortunately, Challonge's API changed and the station manager no longer works because of it. they completely removed the part of the API that was being used.</p>

  <p>i consider the station manager a critical part of runbrackets. i don't know how people who actually use runbrackets feel.</p>

  <p>it's something i can do without relying on the API, but it would take significant development. it's also an old code base and i'd probably want to redo the whole app from scratch.</p>

  <p>if you'd like to keep using runbrackets, i'd totally love to hear from you. i don't mind putting in the work. unfortunately, i have no idea how many active users there are and what their thoughts are.</p>

  <p>please reach out if you want me to work on this again. it'd mean a lot to hear from u.</p>

  <p>my email is <a href="mailto:novacourtois@gmai.com">novacourtois@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p>sincerely, an ICS main</p>
